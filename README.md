### For storing the data [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) Realtime Database is used.

Create a project in Firebase and get started with Realtime Database. Copy the base url and paste in the environment variable
```
FIREBASE_URL=<your project db url>
```

Add 4 items in the realtime database, meals.json, as per the following structure :
```
"m1": {
    "name": "Sushi",
    "description": "The green veggies baked",
    "price": 29.90
}
```
and add the orders from the UI.
